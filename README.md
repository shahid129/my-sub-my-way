## User Experience or User Interface
### First Time User.
As a first time user I want:
- The user to have a warm welcome
- The user to have a clear idea of the ordering system.
- The ordering system to function properly and ordering system to be intuitive.
- The user can understand what the ordering system is about just from the name of the ordering system.
- The user to know the rules of the ordering system.
- Thes system gives the user hint of either to enter number or letters

### As Return or Frequent User.
As a return or frequent user I want:
- To be able to be able to be aknowledged by the system.
- The system to display the last order

### As a Owner of The Game.
As a owner of the game, I want:
- The user to know how to order from the main screen.
- The user to be given option, that if they would like to order more sub.

## Design
Basic design of the game was built using the lucidchart website. The logic of the game was impletented in the 
chart. Once I was satisfied with the logic, I started to code. I tried not to use too many colors and make the terminal look messy.
The colors used are as follows:
- Green - for user inputs
- White - Most of the text
- Red - Whenever the code handled an error and throws an information to the user.
